# ML Practical Related Codes

Below, I have attached codes related to different machine learning practicals that I did in my undergraduate college. 

## [Practical 1](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac1)
Implement Find-S and Candidate Elimination Algorithms

## [Practical 2](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac2)
Implement Decision Tree Algorithm with Post Pruning
## [Practical 3](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac3)
Apply Back Propagation Algorithm
## [Practical 4](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac4)
Radial Basis Function

## [Practical 5](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac5)
Implement K means on 500 random points and create 15 clusters for the same.

## [Practical 6](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac6)
To understand and implement random forest using decision tree. Consider a dataset, make 50 random subdataset of the same and make decision tree for the same. Now use the output from decision tree to get the final output for the dataset.

## [Practical 7](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac7)
Apply Naive Bayes Algorithm on a large dataset and get the accuracy for the same

## [Practical 8](https://github.com/Ishanmittal1404/ML/tree/main/Prac8)
Understand and implement SVM rules on the iris data. The rules would be Linear, Polynomial, Sigmoid and Gaussian
